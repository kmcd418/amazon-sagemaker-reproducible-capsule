name: Predicting disease genes based on multi-head attention fusion
description: This paper proposes an approach to predict the pathogenic gene based
  on multi-head attention fusion (MHAGP). Firstly, the heterogeneous biological information
  networks of disease genes are constructed by integrating multiple biomedical knowledge
  databases. Secondly, two graph representation learning algorithms are used to capture
  the feature vectors of gene-disease pairs from the network, and the features are
  fused by introducing multi-head attention. Finally, multi-layer perceptron model
  is used to predict the gene-disease association.
